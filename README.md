# What's in My Fridge...
A quick recipe look up based on what the user already has in their fridge. User can then look up nutritional value of each of the components that make up the meal.

## Motivation
The novice in the kitchen knows just a few things: what they want to eat; what they have on hand; and, how to use a search engine. What they don't know is how to randomly pluck a recipe out of the air and commit to, *Saffron Rice with Liver Marsala*. Instead, this app aims to cut the over-analyzing and second guessing down by allowing the user to do two things:

1. Open their fridge
2. Search according to what they have already.
