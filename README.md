## Motivation
The novice in the kitchen knows just a few things: 
- what they want to eat. 
- what they have on hand.
- how to use a search engine. 

What they don't know is how to randomly pluck a recipe out of thin air and commit to the process. This app aims to cut the over-analyzing and second guessing down by allowing the user to do two things:

1. Open their fridge
2. Search according to what they have already.
